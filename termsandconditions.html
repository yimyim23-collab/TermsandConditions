    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <h3>1.) Rights</h3>
    <p>By agreeing to the terms and conditions, the individual will be eligible to claim a non-refundable, non-excludable 3000 AED upfront along with PC building assistance. The individual may use this money to buy strictly only PC components or products/services that will aid in the building of the PC.</p>
    <h3>2.) Interest</h3>
    <p>By agreeing to the terms and conditions, the individual will be expected to pay an interest rate of 10% per month on the amount loaned divided by the time period (in months) over a period of 4 years. The individual will be expected to pay this by 11:59 p.m.  on the last of the month including the month the loan is taken. The individual will be able to pay by cash or by crypto. No other forms of payment will be accepted. In the case that the individual wishes to pay by crypto, all network fees above $0.01 will need to be paid for by them. The wallets of the party providing the loan are as follows:</p>

    <h3>3.) Cancellation</h3>
